How to figure out some thing is real or not!

How do we know things ?
It's a really difficult question

## Defining Knowledge

Justified true belief

But how do we know if a belief happens to be true or is, in fact, justified ? 

Defining Knowledge :-

Socrates said :- "I know one thing that I know nothing"

He just couldnt show he knew something. 
How do i show that i know something.

I only know I am thinking.

I think therefore I am.

## The Purist(Skeptical) Perspective

you could be....

A brain in a vat In the Matrix  Dreaming (Inception) In a computer simulation

What are we ? -- >> We might be a simulation from an advanced society trying to understand how things could have gone differently?? (OOOhhhh)

Thinking ==> Existence

1 + 1 = 2

If you dont want to be a cartesian skeptic, knowing something has to be a lower standard. 

How do we really know things ? 
What we know depends on the evidence we have for different factual assertions.

how strong that evidence needs to be depends on the reason we care about  a particular piece of information. 

Standards of evidence (from US legal system) :- 
1. Reasonable Suspicion(traffic stop)
2. Preponderance of Evidence (civil case)
3. Probable cause(arrest)
4. Beyond Reasonable Doubt (conviction)

Five key types of evidence 
1. Proof.
2. Claims
3. Experience
4. Inference
5. Deductive Testing

## Proofs 
-----

Things that can be determined through mathematical or logical reasoning.

Thinking => Existence

1 + 1 = 2

Proofs :- Two types 

1. logical
2. mathematical 

You can evaluate a Proof by assessing whether its logic holds up.

Claims 
------
Things we hear or read from others.

1. New york is America's largest city
2. It takes seven years to digest gum.

The value of claims depends on : -

* Plausibility of the claim. 
* Expertise of the claimant.
* Reliability of the claimant.

## Experience 
The value of experiences depends on :-
    
    * The reliability of our observations. 

## Inference
### Things we assume based on other pieces of evidence.
    * Object permanence
    * Evolutioinary theory
    * John likes pizza because I saw him eating pizza.
## Deductive Testing
    
### The scientific method

The quality of scientific evidence depends on

Match between what was tested and the subject of interest 

Methodological rigor

### Five key types of 
    * Proof: Evidence that can be proved through mathematical or logical reasoning. 
    * Claims: Evidence we've heard or read elsewhere.  
    * Experience: Evidence that relies on what someone has directly encountered or observed.  
    * Inference: Things we assume based on other pieces of evidence.
    * Deductive Testing: evidence that relies on scientific method. 

### What Types of Evidence matter

    You can't live life as a Cartesian skeptic.

If you can't know anything for certain...

Recognize the evidence behind each assertion

Believe that assertion in accordance with the evidence.  

So basically we need a claim --> and it should be backed up by solid evidence for one to believe it as fact.

#### Types of Evidence

Identify Types of Evidence 

1. "306 Electoral Votes is greater than the 270 Electoral Votes needed to win the Electoral College," is an example of a..

 ## The Normative and Actual
